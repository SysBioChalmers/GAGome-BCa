# Description

This repository contains example code and synthetic data sets for the publication "Urinary Free Glycosaminoglycans Identify Adults at High Risk of Developing Early-stage High-grade Bladder Cancer". 

# Usage
Run the Rmarkdown file BCa_GAGome_report.Rmd in order to produce a model for predicting the probability of cancer using urine GAGomes as input data. 
A pre-knitted HTML report is also available if you are not interested in re-running the code yourself.
